== Building from source (Tauri 2)

The recommended way to build the desktop GUI is using the Tauri 2 app in `src-tauri2`, which supports both Windows and Android from one codebase.

* Prerequisites: Rust (with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target), link:https://trunkrs.dev[Trunk], and the Tauri CLI v2 (`cargo install tauri-cli --version 2`).
* From the repository root, build the frontend and package the app:
+
----
cd src-tauri2
cargo tauri build
----
+
On Windows, the installer is produced under `target/release/bundle/msi/`. On Linux, `.deb` and AppImage are under `target/release/bundle/`. The legacy Tauri 1 app in `src-tauri` is still available but deprecated in favor of `src-tauri2`.
